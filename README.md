# Project Euler Problem 208

This project is based on [Project Euler Problem 208](https://projecteuler.net/index.php?section=problems&id=208), 
copied with very slight modifications from [cemulate](https://github.com/cemulate/project-euler-208)'s project of the same name.

## Try it out!
You can try it out online [here](https://peterkagey.github.io/project-euler-208/?n=5&w=2,1,3,1,4,1). 
To modify the step size, change the `n=5` parameter in the URL. (When omitted, it defaults to `n=5`.)
To modify the intial step sequence, change the `w=2,1,3,1,4,1` parameter in the URL. 
To omit the initial step sequence, change it to `w=`, `w=0` or omit it entirely.

## Run locally
Run locally by running `python -m SimpleHTTPServer` in the `project-euler-208` folder.
